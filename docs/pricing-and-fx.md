## Ticker mapping & currency

**Ticker mapping** (`market_data_service.py`) — three tiers: custom `ticker_mappings` row → exchange
suffix → try variations (`.DE`, `.F`, `.L`, bare), then auto-save what worked.
`EXCHANGE_SUFFIXES`: `XETRA`/`IBIS2`→`.DE`, `LSEETF`→`.L`, `AEB`→`.AS`, `KRX`→`.KS`, `TWSE`→`.TW`;
`TSE` is Tokyo (`.T`) **except** for CAD listings, where IBKR means Toronto (`.TO`). Add new exchanges
here when a security has no prices, and verify a ticker in a browser first.

**A wrong auto-discovered mapping is sticky and silent** — the failure that put `SBI@TSE` (Toronto, CAD)
on a US fund for months. The last variation tried is the **bare symbol**, which readily matches an
unrelated US listing of the same ticker; it fetched cleanly, so it was auto-saved — and because tier 1
(`ticker_mappings`) is consulted *first*, that row then shadowed the `.TO` suffix logic even after the
logic was fixed. `_get_currency_from_ticker()` compounded it: with no suffix to read it fell back to
"use the security's currency", stamping USD prices **CAD**, so nothing downstream could see the
mismatch. Result: the position was carried 61% high (7.70 vs 4.78 CAD).

Two guards now: prices carry **the currency Yahoo reports** (read from the history metadata already in
the response — no extra request), and a variation whose currency disagrees with the security's is
**rejected, not adopted, and not saved**. Tests: `tests/test_market_data_service.py`.

**A minor-unit quote defeats that second guard rather than tripping it, so the amount is scaled too.**
Yahoo reports London equities in `GBp` (pence), Johannesburg in `ZAc`, Tel Aviv in `ILA`. The code used
to `.upper()` those into the major code and store the number unchanged — a £5.12 close persisted as
512.4 GBP, **100× high**. And because the normalised code then *matches* the security's own currency,
the disagreement check passes and nothing downstream can see it: the SBI failure with its one safeguard
removed. `MINOR_UNIT_CURRENCIES` now maps each to `(major_code, divisor)`, the label and the amount move
together, and a `TICKER_CURRENCY_OVERRIDES` hit is **never** scaled — an override means someone read the
listing, so the reported code is not evidence.

Explicit map rather than inferring from letter case: `GBp`/`ZAc` are mixed-case but `ILA` is not, so
"not all-uppercase means minor unit" would silently miss Tel Aviv. Extend it like `EXCHANGE_SUFFIXES`.

Latent today, not live — this account holds no GBP security, and its one London line is `SMH@LSEETF`,
a USD ETF pinned `manual` to `SMH.L` (which is also why bare-ticker auto-discovery never grabbed the
NASDAQ SMH). The trap opens the day a UK equity or a GBP-line ETF is bought.

### Managing mappings — `app/cli/manage_mappings.py`

This table decides where every price comes from and was the last one still edited by hand-written SQL
over ssh, where a typo mis-prices a position and looks like a real price. Use the CLI instead:

```bash
docker exec backend-portfolio-backend-1 python -m app.cli.manage_mappings list
docker exec backend-portfolio-backend-1 python -m app.cli.manage_mappings set 2330 TWSE 2330.TW
docker exec backend-portfolio-backend-1 python -m app.cli.manage_mappings disable SBI TSE --purge-prices
```

- **`list`** prints the security's currency beside the one its Yahoo ticker implies. A disagreement
  between those columns *is* the SBI bug, so it's flagged explicitly rather than left to be noticed in
  the portfolio total.
- **`set`** stamps `source='manual'` and **refuses** a ticker whose suffix contradicts the security
  (`SBI.L` → GBP under a CAD security). It reuses `_get_currency_from_ticker()`, so the CLI and the
  fetch path can't drift apart. A *bare* ticker implies no currency and so can't be refused — for a
  foreign listing it warns loudly instead, since that's the exact SBI shape. Storing a mapping before
  the security exists is allowed on purpose: that's how you pin one ahead of the statement.
- **`disable`** sets `is_active=False` rather than deleting (`get_mapping()` already filters on it), so
  the row stops being consulted while the record of what was tried survives. **`--purge-prices`** is the
  whole recovery in one step: drop the prices **and the yfinance dividend estimates** the bad mapping
  produced, and let a scheduled job refill them — incremental caching fetches only missing dates, so
  it costs **no ad-hoc Yahoo call**. IBKR dividend rows are never touched. It purged prices only
  until 2026-07-30, which is how SBI's poisoned estimates outlived its mapping fix.
- `--dry-run` on both mutating commands; every edit records a `sync_runs` row (`manual_mapping`),
  because a mapping change being invisible is why SBI went unnoticed for months.

Tests: `tests/test_mapping_cli.py`.

**Currency** — Frankfurter at `https://api.frankfurter.dev/v1` (`.app` now 301-redirects here).
Batch-fetches date ranges (one call per ~30 days) and carries the last known rate forward across
weekends/holidays.

Frankfurter republishes the **ECB reference rates**, so its list is fixed at the ECB's 30 + EUR and will
never include TWD, RUB, QAR or SAR. That is not cosmetic: an unconvertible currency makes
`reconcile_taxlots()` skip the lot, so the holding vanishes from the portfolio *and* the tax report
(counted in `taxlots_skipped`, reported in `warnings[]`). Buying TSMC on TWSE hit exactly this.

So `CurrencyService` falls back to `https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/EUR`, tagging rows
`source='er-api-latest'`. It is EUR-based (`rate = rates[to] / rates[from]`) and **latest-only — there
is no free historical endpoint**, so it is used only within `FALLBACK_MAX_AGE_DAYS` (7) of today and
refuses older dates rather than backdating a current rate onto an old tax lot. Never raises;
`get_exchange_rate()` owns that decision.

`get_exchange_rate()` resolves in this order, and the order is the design:
**cache → Frankfurter → carry-forward → fallback → carry-forward → raise.**

- Carry-forward comes *before* the fallback because Friday's real ECB rate beats today's
  approximation over a weekend. It preserves the source tag of the row it copies.
- The fallback now also covers currencies that *are* in `SUPPORTED_CURRENCIES` when Frankfurter
  answers with nothing. That demotes the hardcoded list from load-bearing to advisory: a provider
  outage or the ECB list drifting degrades the rate instead of erasing a position (a raise here makes
  `reconcile_taxlots()` skip the lot, so the holding disappears from the portfolio *and* the tax
  report). It is never reached while Frankfurter is answering — no silent provider switching.

**`WARM_CURRENCIES`** (`TWD, CNH, AED, SAR, QAR, KWD, RUB, CLP, COP`) is warmed daily by
`sync_exchange_rates` alongside the currencies actually held, via `warm_rates()`. Only currencies
Frankfurter *cannot* serve are listed, because those are the ones whose history can only accumulate
forward — an ECB rate is retrievable at any time, so warming it would be waste. The whole set costs
**one** request (`_fetch_fallback_table()` returns all ~166 at once), which is what makes daily
affordable. Without it, TWD only got a rate on days a lot happened to need one, so missing the 7-day
window once meant the lot was skipped forever. Extending the list is one edit and no extra request.

Tests: `tests/test_currency_fallback.py`.
